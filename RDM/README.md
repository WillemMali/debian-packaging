# Reddit Desktop Manager (RDM) #
I want to package RDM because there currently is no Debian package available for it, and I prefer not to manually install any software ever. It'll also be interesting practice for packaging GUI applications.

## Repository ##

The repository for my RDM package can be found [here](https://github.com/WillemMali/dpkg-rdm/).
